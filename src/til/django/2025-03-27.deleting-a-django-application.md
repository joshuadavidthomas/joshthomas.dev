title: Deleting a Django application
---

> [!DOCUMENTATION]
>
> Django provides the ability to group sets of features into Python packages called [applications](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/applications/). When requirements change, apps may become obsolete or unnecessary. The following steps will help you delete an application safely.
> 
> 1. Remove all references to the app (imports, foreign keys etc.).
> 2. Remove all models from the corresponding `models.py` file.
> 3. Create relevant migrations by running [`makemigrations`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations). This step generates a migration that deletes tables for the removed models, and any other required migration for updating relationships connected to those models.
> 4. [Squash](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/#migration-squashing) out references to the app in other apps’ migrations.
> 5. Apply migrations locally, runs tests, and verify the correctness of your project.
> 6. Deploy/release your updated Django project.
> 7. Remove the app from [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS).
> 8. Finally, remove the app’s directory.
