title: Syntax Highlighting with the `llm` CLI tool
---

## Outline

- I've been aware of Simon Willison's `llm` CLI tool for a while, but haven't actually sat down and really used it.
- Normally use a mixture of `aider`, Anthropic's Claude Code `claude` CLI tool (new addition)
- Have used Copilot (get a free subscription because of OSS contributions on GitHub), but haven't in a long time
- Read a recent post from Simon about the release of Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 where he showed off two of his tools, `llm` and `files-to-prompt` to shove the entirety of a codebase into the context window -- possible because of Gemini 2.5's massic 1 million input token limit.
- Had a tricky problem to solve in a work repo (involving pending invoices and ledger entries), thought I might as well try the same approach
- Worked, but `llm` output is plain

```bash
$ llm -s 'show me three different implementations of the fibonacci sequence in Python, starting simple and increasing in complexity'
```

- Wanted syntax hightlighting and markdown rendering
- `llm` is designed in the UNIX philosophy, where one tool does one job, but can be combined and piped with others
- started with bat

```bash
$ llm -s 'show me three different implementations of the fibonacci sequence in Python, starting simple and increasing in complexity' | bat --language=markdown --paging=never --style=plain
```

- lots to type everytime, made a fish wrapper

```fish
function llm --wraps=llm
    command llm $argv | bat --language=markdown --paging=never --style=plain
end
```

- worked perfectly, found out about the `glow` tool

```fish
function llm --wraps=llm
    command llm $argv | glow -
end
```
