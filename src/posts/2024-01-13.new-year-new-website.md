It's a new year and I've decided to rebuild my personal website.

Again.

I wanted to write a much longer post about the history of my personal website -- and I definitely will later, unless my ADHD gets the better of me -- but if I don't at least write something, I'll never get this website refresh out the door. For now I'll just say, I've settled on using the language and framework I'm most comfortable with, Python and Django.

This site has been through many iterations built with so many different languages and frameworks over the years. It's been fun to dabble and it's taught me a lot. That's what I like best about having a personal website, being able to try out new things in public but with relatively low stakes.

But these days with a very busy full time job, 2 kids, a wife, a house and yard to take care of, and the desire to have some fun with my free time, I find I just don't have the patience for the upkeep that comes with using something I don't know for this site. I still want this to be a playground for exploring new ideas, but for now I'm choosing the [boring](https://boringtechnology.club) choice and going with what I know.

For those curious, the site is open source and is available over on my [GitHub](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/joshthomas.dev) profile.
